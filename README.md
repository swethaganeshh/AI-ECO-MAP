## Eco-Scoring Methodology

The eco-score (0-100) considers:

1. **Transportation Mode** (40% weight)
   - Walking/Cycling: 95-100 points
   - Driving: 30 points
   - Heavy vehicles: 15 points

2. **Air Quality Impact** (25% weight)
   - Good AQI (1-2): Bonus points
   - Poor AQI (4-5): Penalty points

3. **Distance Efficiency** (20% weight)
   - Shorter routes receive bonus points
   - Long routes get distance penalty

4. **Weather Conditions** (15% weight)
   - Favorable weather: Bonus for outdoor modes
   - Poor weather: Penalty for walking/cycling

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
```
ORS_API_KEY=your_openrouteservice_key
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
